# User Stories (from the perspective of a user):

1. I want to add a new todo so I can track tasks I need to do.
2. I want to mark a todo as completed so I can see what I finished.
3. I want to remove a todo so I can keep my list clean.
4. I want to filter todos (all/completed/incomplete) so I can focus on what matters.
5. I want to submit a contact form so I can send feedback.
